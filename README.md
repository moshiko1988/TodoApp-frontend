## Process and Technologies


> As this is the first full stack project that i worked on i approached this project carefully and > slowly.
> I started with the back end, i used ruby on rails to  created the database that my app need to function
> and then i moved to work on the front end.
> I created basic layout with html and css and then worked displaying the content with handlebars
> when i got to a point that my app worked as expected i started working on the UI.
> I styled the page with css and bootstrap.
