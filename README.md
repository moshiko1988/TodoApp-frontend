## Process and Technologies


> As this is the first full stack project that I worked on I approached this project carefully and slowly.
> I started with the back end, so I used ruby on rails to create the database that my app needs to function
> and then I moved on to work on the front end.
> I created a basic layout with html and css and then worked on displaying the content with handlebars
> when I got to the point where my app worked as expected.Then, I started working on the UI.
> I stylized the page with css and bootstrap.



## Future Goals and Unsolved Problems

> - Making a user create different notes whitin the app that contain different lists
> - Making the user be able to change the order of the list
> - Making the user be able to upload photos
